This Python program creates and solves mazes visually using depth-first search (DFS) algorithms. 
It employs the graphics.py library for rendering, numpy for array management, and random for generating random maze pathways.
The program sets up a graphical window and maze dimensions.
It randomly creates a solvable maze using a DFS algorithm
It solves the maze using DFS, marking the path in red.
It waits for a mouse click to regenerate and solve a new maze.
